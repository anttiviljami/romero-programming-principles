# John Romero's Principles for Programmers

Valuable programming principles from the early ID Software days as shared by
John Romero in his talk at GDC Europe 2016.

## Principle 1: No prototypes

No prototypes. Just make the game. Polish as you go. Don't depend on polish
happening later. Always maintain constantly shippable code.

## Principle 2: Fallbacks on load failure

It's incredibly important that your game can always be run by your team.
Bulletproof your engine by providing defaults upon load failure.

## Principle 3: Simplify

Keep your code absolutely simple. Keep looking at your functions and figure
out how you can simplify further.

## Principle 4: Focus on tools

Great tools help make great games. Spend as much time on tools as possible.

## Principle 5: Don't rely on testers

We are our own best testing team and should never allow anyone else to
experience bugs or see the game crash. Don't waste other's time. Test
thoroughly before checking in your code.

## Principle 6: Fix bugs immediately

As soon as you see a bug, you fix it. Do not continue on. If you don't fix
your bugs your new code will be built on a buggy codebase and ensure an
unstable foudnation.

## Principle 7: Target less powerful systems

Use a superior development system than your target.

## Principle 8: Don't write code for future projects

Write your code for this game only - not for a future game. You're going to
be writing new code later because you'll be smarter.

## Principle 9: Write modular code

Encapsulate functionality to ensure design consistency. This minimizes
mistakes and saves design time.

## Principle 10: Transparent coding

Try to code transparently. Tell your lead and peers exactly how you are going
to solve your current task and get feedback and advice. Do not treat game
programming like each coder is a black box. The project cloud go off the rails
and cause delays.

## Principle 11: Embrace differences in programmers

Programming is a creative art form based in logic. Every programmer is
different and will code differently. It's the output that matters.
